1. Check https://slimbootloader.github.io/getting-started/build-host-setup.html for build host setup.

2. Start a new command line window different than the one used for building Payload.

3. Download Slim Bootloader:
  Run DownloadSlimBootloader.py in folder UefiPayloadPkg\Tools.

4. Download stitching base binary (Optional, only needed for minnowboard3)
  1). Go to https://firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard3.
  2). Choose the latest version of MinnowBoard Firmware Images to download.
  3). Pick one image from the downloaded zip and put it into folder UefiPayloadPkg\WorkSpace\SlimBootloader\.
  4). Rename the binary "base.bin".

5. Build Slim Bootloader
  Run SlimBootloaderIntegration.bat or SlimBootloaderIntegration.sh in UefiPayloadPkg\Tools depending on your os.
  The parameters should match the ones used in building payload.
  For example:
    If you built payload with command "BuildPayload.bat Qemu X64 DEBUG", you should use "SlimBootloaderIntegration.bat Qemu X64 DEBUG" to build Slim Bootloader
  The resulting image is in UefiPayloadPkg named firmware.bin.
