# Integration
EdkRepo could live in several places:
1. edk2-platforms
2. edk2-pytool-library
3. The edk2-toolenv repository proposed by Sean (assuming approval of Seanâ€™s RFC)
4. A new, separate repository created for EdkRepo

This is a topic that requires community discussion to decide what the final location should be.
